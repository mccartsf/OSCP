What is an SSRF?

Server-Side Request Forgery - vulnerability that allows malicious users to cause web servers to make HTTP requests to resources of an attackers choosing 

Examples of what SSRF can achieve:
- Access to unauthorized information
- Access to customer/organization data
- Ability to scale internal networks
- Reveal authentication tokens/credentials


### SSRF using URL Modification
Ex. 

Expected Request -> https://wbesite.com/stock?url=https://website.com/api/stock/item?id=123

Hacker Requests ->    https://wbesite.com/stock?url=https://website.com/api/user

Website Requests ->  https://website.com/api/user

 Hackers are able to add URL values to existing requests that will return different output

### SSFR using Directory Transversal
Ex. 

Expected Request -> https://wbesite.com/stock?url=/item?id=123

Hacker Requests ->    https://wbesite.com/stock?url=/../user

Website Requests ->  https://website.com/api/stock/../user


### Using "&x=" in HTML requests

- Payloads that end with "&x=" can stop the remaining path of URL from being appended and instead turn it into a parameter
