### Port Scanning
- Port scanning modules have a few options when running:
	1)  **CONCURRENCY:** Number of targets to be scanned simultaneously.
	
	2)  **PORTS:** Port range to be scanned. Please note that 1-1000 here will not be the same as using Nmap with the default configuration. Nmap will scan the 1000 most used ports, while Metasploit will scan port numbers from 1 to 10000.
	
	3) **RHOSTS:** Target or target network to be scanned.
	
	4) **THREADS:** Number of threads that will be used simultaneously. More threads will result in faster scans.
