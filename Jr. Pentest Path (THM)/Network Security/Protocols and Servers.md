- Send data as cleartext (unencrypted)
- Telnet (or Netcat) can be used to communicate with FTP servers and act as an FTP client

1) Active -> Data is sent over a separate channel originating from the FTP server's ==port 20==
2) Passive -> Data is sent over a separate channel originating from the FTP client's port above ==port number 1023==


 To start a connection using FTP, use the `ftp` command


### SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)

- Used to deliver emails over the internet

Email delivery over the Internet requires:
1) Mail Submission Agent (MSA)
2) Mail Transfer Agent (MTA)
3) Mail Delivery Agent (MDA)
4) Mail User Agent (MUA)

Five steps that an email needs to go through to reach the recipient’s inbox:

1. A Mail User Agent (MUA), or simply an email client, has an email message to be sent. The MUA connects to a Mail Submission Agent (MSA) to send its message.
2. The MSA receives the message, checks for any errors before transferring it to the Mail Transfer Agent (MTA) server, commonly hosted on the same server.
3. The MTA will send the email message to the MTA of the recipient. The MTA can also function as a Mail Submission Agent (MSA).
4. A typical setup would have the MTA server also functioning as a Mail Delivery Agent (MDA).
5. The recipient will collect its email from the MDA using their email client.

### Pop3 (Post Office Protocol version 3)

- Protocol used to download email messages from a Mail Delivery Agent server
- Default ==Port 110==

#### Internet Messaging Access Protocol (IMAP)

- Synchronized email across multiple device 
- Default ==port 143==

#### Command Line Commands
	LOGIN -> authenticate into the protocol
	c1, c2, c3 ... -> each individual command gets a string to track replies
	LIST -> list the mail folders
	EXAMINE INBOX -> check if there are any new messages in the inbox
