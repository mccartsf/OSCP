### Important Commands

	hostname -> will return the hostname of the machine
	uname -a -> will print system information gving us additional detail about a systems kernel
	
	/proc/version -> The proc filesystem (procfs) provides information about the target system processes.
		*Looking at `/proc/version` may give you information on the kernel version and additional data such as whether a compiler (e.g. GCC) is installed.

	/etc/issue -> This file usually contains some information about the operating system but can easily be customized or changed

	ps -> shows the running processes on a Linux system
		Output shows:
		PID: The process ID (unique to the process)
		TTY: Terminal type used by the user
		Time: Amount of CPU time used by the process (this is NOT the time this process has been running for)
		CMD: The command or executable running (will NOT display any command line parameter)

	env -> shows environment variables

	sudo -l -> used to list all commands a user can run with sudo

	id -> provides a general overview of the user's privelage level and group memberships

	history -> shows all of the commands run previously in the session

	ifconfig ->  will give us information about the network interfaces of the system

	netstat:
		 `netstat -a`: shows all listening ports and established connections.
		`netstat -at` or `netstat -au` can also be used to list TCP or UDP protocols respectively.
		 `netstat -l`: list ports in “listening” mode. These ports are open and ready to accept incoming connections. This can be used with the “t” option to list only ports that are listening using the TCP protocol (below)
		`netstat -s`: list network usage statistics by protocol (below) This can also be used with the `-t` or `-u` options to limit the output to a specific protocol. 
		`netstat -tp`: list connections with the service name and PID information.

	/etc/os-release -> shows all of the relevant information about the current host's os system

### SUDO (Escalation)

LD_PRELOAD is a function that allows any program to use shared libraries. If the "env_keep" option is enabled we can generate a shared library which will be loaded and executed before the program is run. Please note the LD_PRELOAD option will be ignored if the real user ID is different from the effective user ID.  

The steps of this privilege escalation vector can be summarized as follows;

1. Check for LD_PRELOAD (with the env_keep option)
2. Write a simple C code compiled as a share object (.so extension) file
3. Run the program with sudo rights and the LD_PRELOAD option pointing to our .so file


### SUID ( set-user identification escalation)

Files with an "s" permission on them 

To find files with this special ownership, run:

	find / -type f -perm -04000 -ls 2>/dev/null

#### Method of Escalation

1) Reading the /etc/shadow file


2) Adding the current user to the /etc/passwd file
